# Contributing to Last Resort
Don't feel intimidated, we're not judgemental here. Your help is valued and appreciated.

### How can I contribute?
Check out the [issues page](https://github.com/jakeledoux/lastresort/issues) and see if there's anything you'd like to help with. If there is, assign yourself and give it a try! If nothing there interests you or there's something specific you want to add, create a new issue with the label "request to implement" and describe what feature or change you want to implement. I'll either give you the go-ahead or let you know why that change isn't necessary at the moment.

### How skilled do I need to be?
Not very. I'm new to extension development and make mistakes all the time. All I ask is that you're somewhat experience with programming in general, even if it's with a different language, and that you respect the style and format of the code I've written already and adhere to that as best you can.

## Thanks for your help!
